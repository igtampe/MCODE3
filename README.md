# MCODE3
MCODE is a simple app done to convert text from Morse Code to Text, Or Text to Morse Code (Playing sounds for dots and dashes when displayed)

MCODE let's you type and convert text (either line by line, or in "live" mode by typing "/LIVE") to Morse Code. It also knows to decode Morse Code when given it (by checking if the provided line starts with a . or a -). 

MCODE can also open text files and convert them. Simply drag and drop a file onto the executable and the beeps and bips will commence.

This program is a rewrite of an older batch file called MCODE2, and boasts significant performance boosts thanks to the fact that it handles its own sound playing. It's also done to play around with .NET 5.0 a little.
